# **Study Buddy**
 Easily find who is on campus

## **1. Description**
  Study Buddy is a mobile application designed to help students easily see the status of their friends. The app allows users to track their friends' availability with three simple statuses:

1. **On Campus (Free)** - The user is on campus and available.
2. **Busy** - The user is on campus but currently unavailable.
3. **Offline** - The user is not on campus or has set their status as offline.

The app makes it easy for students to know when their friends are free to study together or when they are busy, helping them plan study sessions more effectively.
